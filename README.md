# work-day-scheduler-ch5
This is a work day scheduler created for UM Coding Bootcamp challenge 5.


**Description**


I was tasked with creating a work day scheduler, which included each hour of workday hours, by utilizing dynamically updated HTML and CSS using jQuery. When the page loads, any items stored in localStorage are displayed in the corresponding time blocks as the user had input using the text area and save button.



## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
